# Coursework in F28WP-MMORPG - Web Programming

We are creating the prototype for a Massively Multiplayer Online game (MMO). The idea behind it is that the players will move about the
game area collecting coins, and after a minute the player with the highest score will be declared the winner. The players scores will 
then be uploaded to a database under their usernames and the highest scores will be displayed on a scoreboard.

# Details
For this project we are planning to make use of a range of software for both the front and back-end of the game and adjoining website.
For the front-end we will be using HTML5, CSS and javascript, and for the back-end we will be using MySQL, PHP, AJAX and JSON however this
is subject to change as the project enters the later stages of development.

# Objectives
- Stage 1:
    - Create a complete version of the single player aspect of the game
    - Create a functioning database in MySQL or another database software
    
- Stage 2:
    - To be able to alter the database through javascript interaction
    - To be able to connect the database to the game in order to host a live scoreboard
    
- Stage 3:
     - To be able to host the game on a server in order to have a multiplayer experience
